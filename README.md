## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

&nbsp;  
### What I learned

This project served as more practice to my grid and flexbox knowledge, and general HTML and CSS mastery. I am becoming much more conscious of the tidiness of my code, and how to make it easier for others and myself to read. 

&nbsp;  
### Continued development

I look forward to continuing to practice my HTML and CSS as they proceed to become more intuitive to me, and paying more attention to my code and the way I am writing it.
